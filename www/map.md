## Maps

Enter the `ipm_id`s (e.g. `aaa310`), or species/genus (e.g. `Carpobrotus` or `Ovis, Aconitum, Carpobrotus edulis`) names you wish to map. Multiple entries can be separated with a comma. Once entered, click submit to generate the map. Use the word "all" to see locations for every IPM in PADRINO. Click on a marker to see which species the point corresponds to. Links in the pop up window will take you to the original publication (when possible). The download button will download the map extent that is visible *immediately after submission*. Additional zooming and movement will not be registered by the download mechanism.
