## PADRINO Database Dashboard

Welcome to the PADRINO summary dashboard. This is a very new tool and is still under active development. The recommended usage is to explore which species are in the database using the Metadata and Maps tabs, and then check out the basic analyses in the Models tab. As time goes on, this will become a bit more comprehensive. 


```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "asis"}

library(dplyr)
library(RPadrino)
library(xtable)

pdb <- pdb_download(FALSE)

tab <- pdb$Metadata %>%
  group_by(kingdom) %>%
  summarise(n_ipm_id = length(unique(ipm_id)),
            n_spp    = length(unique(species_accepted)),
            n_pub    = length(unique(apa_citation))) %>%
  setNames(c("   Kingdom   ", "   # of ipm_id's   ", 
             "   # of Species   ", "   # of Publications   "))

print(xtable(tab), type = "html", include.rownames = FALSE)

```
