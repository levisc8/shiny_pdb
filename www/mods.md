## Explore Models

Enter the `ipm_id`s (e.g. `aaa310`), or species/genus
(e.g. `Carpobrotus` or `Ovis, Aconitum, Carpobrotus edulis`) names you
wish to map. Multiple entries can be separated with a comma. Once
entered, click submit to generate the model outputs. Right now, only *λ*
is computed, and a heat map shows the how the population changes through
time. More computations will be added shortly.

> NB: Trying to create too many models will cause the app to crash. Some
> species comprise a disproportionate number of IPMs in PADRINO. For
> example *Aeonium haworthii* has \~80 IPMs. This is too many for the
> Shiny server to handle. Some trial and error may be needed to work out
> exactly how many models are OK to run simultaneously.
