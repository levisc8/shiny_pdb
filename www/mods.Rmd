## Explore Models

Enter the `ipm_id`s (e.g. `aaa310`), or species/genus (e.g. `Carpobrotus` or `Ovis, Aconitum, Carpobrotus edulis`) names you wish to map. Multiple entries can be separated with a comma. Once entered, click submit to generate the model outputs. Right now, only $\lambda$ is computed, and a heat map shows the how the population changes through time. More computations will be added shortly.
