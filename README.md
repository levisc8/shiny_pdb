# PADRINO Database Dashboard App

This houses an app for exploring the data in PADRINO. Its functionality is currently pretty limited - you can:

1. Examine how many species, IPMs, and publications there are based on any combination of variables in the [Metadata](https://levisc8.github.io/Padrino/digitization-guide.html#metadata) table.

2. Explore the geographic distribution of IPMs in PADRINO with the interactive maps tab. 

The app is on the web and you can find it [here](https://sam-levin.shinyapps.io/shiny_pdb/). It will be updated as new features are added. If you'd like to request specific ones, please use the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/levisc8/shiny_pdb/issues).
